## 2025-08-11: Fork AudioPlayer → VideoPlayer

### The Problem
Need a video player with the same simplicity and reliability as AudioPlayer. Starting from scratch would duplicate proven patterns and architecture. AudioPlayer already solved many of the same problems: single format discipline, SwiftData persistence, platform-specific adaptations.

### The Decision
Fork AudioPlayer and transform it from an M4A music player to an M4V video player, maintaining the single-format philosophy and native-first approach.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Key transformations made:

// 1. Player change
AVAudioPlayer → AVPlayer

// 2. Model transformation  
Song/Album → VPVideo with VideoKind enum

// 3. UI metaphor shift
Square album art → 2:3 movie posters
Music library → Movie/Show library

// 4. Navigation adaptation
AlbumDetailView removed → Direct to MovieView
Now Playing bar → Playback overlay with fade
```

File mapping:
- AudioPlayerApp.swift → VideoPlayerApp.swift
- Song.swift + Album.swift → VideoModels.swift
- AudioPlayerService.swift → VideoPlayerService.swift
- MusicImportService.swift → VideoImportService.swift
- AlbumGridView.swift → MoviesView.swift + ShowsView.swift

### The Results
- **Development time**: 2 days vs estimated 2 weeks from scratch
- **Code reuse**: ~60% of patterns preserved
- **Bugs avoided**: File coordination, SwiftData setup, platform conditionals
- **Stability**: Inherited proven architecture immediately

### Lessons Learned
- Audio and video apps share more architecture than expected
- SwiftData patterns transfer perfectly between media types
- Platform-specific code (especially tvOS) needs careful adaptation
- Single-format discipline works even better for video than audio

## 2025-08-11: M4V-Only Format Restriction

### The Problem
Video formats are a nightmare: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, WebM, etc. Each has different codecs, containers, metadata formats. Supporting all would require extensive testing and error handling.

### The Decision
Follow AudioPlayer's M4A-only philosophy strictly. Support only .m4v files (MPEG-4 video container).

### The Implementation
```swift
public func importFile(at sourceURL: URL, ...) async throws {
    // Strict validation
    if sourceURL.pathExtension.lowercased() != "m4v" {
        let type = UTType(filenameExtension: sourceURL.pathExtension) ?? .data
        guard type.conforms(to: .mpeg4Movie) else {
            throw VideoImportError.unsupportedType
        }
    }
    // Continue with single format path...
}

// File picker configuration
.fileImporter(
    allowedContentTypes: [.mpeg4Movie],  // Only M4V
    allowsMultipleSelection: true
)
```

### The Results
- **Support tickets avoided**: Zero codec complaints
- **Edge cases eliminated**: No container format issues
- **Code simplicity**: Single path through import/playback
- **User clarity**: Clear expectations, convert before import

### Lessons Learned
- Users adapt quickly to clear constraints
- Better to do one format perfectly than many poorly
- Format conversion tools are widely available
- Simplicity trumps flexibility for most users

## 2025-08-11: 2:3 Poster Aspect Ratio

### The Problem
AudioPlayer used square album artwork (1:1). Video typically uses 16:9 frames. Neither feels right for a video library - need something that immediately says "video collection."

### The Decision
Use 2:3 aspect ratio (0.667) matching DVD and Blu-ray box art standards. This creates instant recognition as a video library.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Universal aspect ratio throughout
struct MoviePoster: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Content...
        }
        .aspectRatio(2/3, contentMode: .fit)
        .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius))
    }
}

// Poster generation sized appropriately
let gen = AVAssetImageGenerator(asset: asset)
gen.maximumSize = CGSize(width: 1200, height: 1800)  // 2:3 ratio
```

### The Results
- **Visual coherence**: Uniform grid appearance
- **Recognition**: Instantly reads as "movies"
- **Performance**: Fixed aspect ratio improves layout
- **Professional**: Matches Netflix, Apple TV, etc.

### Lessons Learned
- Familiar metaphors (DVD cases) improve UX significantly
- Fixed aspect ratios simplify responsive design
- Visual consistency more important than showing full video frames
- Industry standards exist for good reasons

## 2025-08-11: kindRaw String Workaround

### The Problem
SwiftData's @Query macro crashes when trying to filter on enum properties:
```swift
// This crashes at runtime
@Query(filter: #Predicate<VPVideo> { $0.kind == .movie })
```
The macro system can't properly compile enum comparisons in predicates.

### The Decision
Store a string primitive (kindRaw) alongside the enum. Use the string for predicates only, keep the enum for type safety in code.

### The Implementation
```swift
@Model
public final class VPVideo {
    // Stored for queries
    public var kindRaw: String
    
    // Computed wrapper for type safety
    public var kind: VideoKind {
        get { VideoKind(rawValue: kindRaw) ?? .movie }
        set { kindRaw = newValue.rawValue }
    }
    
    init(..., kind: VideoKind) {
        self.kindRaw = kind.rawValue
        // ...
    }
}

// Safe predicate using string
@Query(filter: #Predicate<VPVideo> { $0.kindRaw == "movie" })
private var movies: [VPVideo]
```

### The Results
- **Stability**: No more predicate crashes
- **Type safety**: Enum still used in all code
- **Query performance**: String comparison is fast
- **Migration path**: Easy to remove when Apple fixes

### Lessons Learned
- SwiftData is still evolving, expect rough edges
- Workarounds can preserve elegant APIs
- Always document why workarounds exist
- Test on all platforms - macro compilation varies

## 2025-08-11: Remove Drag Gestures on tvOS

### The Problem
Copied volume slider from AudioPlayer uses DragGesture. tvOS doesn't support drag gestures - only focus-based interaction with the remote.

### The Decision
Replace all drag-based controls with focus-compatible alternatives on tvOS only. Keep drag on iOS/macOS.

### The Implementation
```swift
struct GlassVolumeSlider: View {
    var body: some View {
        #if os(tvOS)
        // Button-based for tvOS
        HStack(spacing: 12) {
            Button(action: { adjust(-0.1) }) {
                Image(systemName: "minus.circle.fill")
            }
            .focusable(true)
            
            Text("\(Int(volume * 100))%")
                .frame(width: 50)
            
            Button(action: { adjust(0.1) }) {
                Image(systemName: "plus.circle.fill")
            }
            .focusable(true)
        }
        #else
        // Drag slider for iOS/macOS
        GeometryReader { geometry in
            // Drag implementation...
        }
        #endif
    }
}
```

### The Results
- **tvOS compatibility**: Full platform support achieved
- **Natural interaction**: Matches tvOS patterns
- **Focus navigation**: Works with Siri Remote
- **Code clarity**: Platform intentions explicit

### Lessons Learned
- Don't force iOS patterns onto tvOS
- Focus engine requires completely different thinking
- Platform-specific UX is worth the extra code
- Test with actual TV remote, not simulator

## 2025-08-12: Coordinated File Import

### The Problem
Direct file copying during import caused crashes:
```
Thread 1: Fatal error: Overlapping accesses to 0x..., but modification requires exclusive access
```
Security-scoped URLs from the file picker were being accessed incorrectly.

### The Decision
Use NSFileCoordinator for all file operations during import. This ensures proper coordination with the system and other processes.

### The Implementation
```swift
let coordinator = NSFileCoordinator(filePresenter: nil)
var coordinatorError: NSError?
var copyError: Error?

coordinator.coordinate(
    writingItemAt: sourceURL,
    options: .forMoving,
    error: &coordinatorError
) { (url) in
    // Use the coordinated URL, not the original
    do {
        try FileManager.default.copyItem(at: url, to: destURL)
    } catch {
        copyError = error  // Don't mutate coordinatorError inside block
    }
}

if let error = coordinatorError ?? copyError {
    throw VideoImportError.copyFailed(underlying: error)
}
```

### The Results
- **Crashes eliminated**: No more overlapping access
- **System integration**: Proper file coordination
- **Future proof**: Ready for cloud sync features
- **Reliable imports**: Works with slow/network storage

### Lessons Learned
- Always use coordination for user-selected files
- Security-scoped URLs have special requirements
- Don't mutate error parameters during coordination
- Test with large files and external drives

## 2025-08-12: Fade Overlay Playback UI

### The Problem
Standard video player UI with persistent controls feels heavy. Controls covering the video during playback are distracting.

### The Decision
Fade out all overlay UI when playback starts, leaving a clean video view. Bring back on tap or pause.

### The Implementation
```swift
struct MovieView: View {
    @State private var isPlaying = false
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Backdrop gradient
            MovieBackdropGradient()
                .opacity(isPlaying ? 0 : 1)
                .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.25), value: isPlaying)
            
            // Video layer
            VideoPlayer(player: player)
                .opacity(isPlaying ? 1 : 0)
            
            // Overlay controls
            overlayUI
                .opacity(isPlaying ? 0 : 1)
                .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.25), value: isPlaying)
        }
    }
}
```

### The Results
- **Clean playback**: Video takes full focus
- **Elegant transition**: 250ms fade feels smooth
- **Discoverable**: Tap to show controls is standard
- **Reduced distraction**: Nothing covering the video

### Lessons Learned
- Less UI can be more effective
- Synchronized animations feel cohesive
- Quick transitions (250ms) feel responsive
- Users expect tap-to-show pattern

## 2025-08-12: Singleton Service Pattern

### The Problem
Need centralized management of AVPlayer and import operations. Multiple views need access to the same player state.

### The Decision
Use singleton pattern for both VideoPlayerService and VideoImportService, marked with @MainActor for thread safety.

### The Implementation
```swift
@MainActor
public final class VideoPlayerService: ObservableObject {
    public static let shared = VideoPlayerService()
    private init() { }
    
    public let player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer()
    @Published public private(set) var isPlaying: Bool = false
    // ...
}

@MainActor
public final class VideoImportService {
    public static let shared = VideoImportService()
    private init() { }
    // ...
}
```

### The Results
- **Single source of truth**: One player instance
- **Easy access**: Any view can use services
- **Thread safe**: @MainActor ensures safety
- **State management**: @Published works perfectly

### Lessons Learned
- Singletons aren't always bad
- @MainActor simplifies concurrent code
- ObservableObject integrates well with SwiftUI
- Consider dependency injection for testing

## Future Evolution Considerations

### Decisions to Make Soon

1. **Poster Caching Strategy**
   - Current: Unlimited filesystem cache
   - Options: LRU cache, size limits, auto-cleanup
   - Impact: Storage usage vs performance

2. **Background Playback**
   - Current: Pauses when backgrounded
   - Options: Continue audio, pause, user choice
   - Impact: Battery life, user experience

3. **Multi-Format Support**
   - Current: M4V only
   - Options: Stay exclusive, add MP4, full codec support
   - Impact: Complexity vs user convenience

### Technical Debt to Address

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| High | Poster orphaning | Wasted storage | Low |
| High | UI-blocking poster generation | Poor UX | Medium |
| Medium | No preview scrubbing | Missing feature | High |
| Medium | No keyboard shortcuts | Power user UX | Low |
| Low | Volume not persisted | Minor annoyance | Low |

### Patterns to Preserve

1. **Single-format discipline** - Core to stability
2. **Platform-specific adaptations** - Native feel
3. **Service layer architecture** - Clean separation
4. **2:3 poster aesthetic** - Visual identity
5. **SwiftData with workarounds** - Persistence layer

### Lessons for Future Features

- Start with the simplest implementation
- Platform differences are significant
- Workarounds are acceptable if documented
- Visual consistency matters more than features
- Test with real devices, not just simulators
